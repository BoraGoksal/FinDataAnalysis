## About The Project

---

This repository has code that analyses financial data for Apple(AAPL), Google(GOOGL), Microsoft(MSFT) and Netflix(NFLX)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be found in the notebooks folder.

I started this project to improve my:

- Financial analysis 
- Financial Variables/Metrics/inferences
-  scikit-learn 
- To develop statistical machine learning models with financial data


## Data

----
### _raw/_

This folder holds the raw data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT AND NFLX

## Scripts


---

### _data_processing.py_

This Python file processes the data that is downloaded from Yahoo finance and saves them as CSV files in raw/

### _regression_models.py_

This Python file is where the regression model is created, this is currently a linear regression model. However, this will be updated as my knowledge of machine learning with financial data develops. 

### _visualisations.py_

This Python file contains code that will produce visualisations based on the regression model and general statistics
